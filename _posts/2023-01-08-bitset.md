A bitset is a data structure used to represent a set of integers.
Given integer is represeted in bitset by the index of the bit.
If the integer is in the set then the bit is set to 1, 0 otherwise.
We can inplement a bitset as an array of `Long` values.
`Long` has 64 bits which means it allows us to represent 64 integers.
That's what makes bitsets compact.

Let's look at a diagram to understand better how information is encoded in bitset.

{: refdef}

As we can see we store the information about values 0-63 in the first `Long`,
64-127 in the second `Long` and so on.
This is the structure of the bitset.
Now let's describe the most important operations supported by this
data structure.

### Checking if value is in the set
How do we check whether an integer is in the set?
We first need to calculate the index of the `Long` which is used
to store the information about the integer and then the offset within this `Long`.
For example, to check if 3 is in the set, we divide 3 by 64 (the length of `Long`):
```scala
val index = 3 / 64 // 0
```
To find the offset within the `Long` we take 3 modulo 64:
```scala
val offset = 3 % 64 // 3
```
We use the `index` to access the `Long` in the array:
```scala
ar(index)
```
We use the `offset` to create a `Long` value with only the nth bit set:
```scala
1L << offset
```
Then we do a bitwise "and" of the two values and check whether the result is not 0.
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

Here's the code of the `get` function:
```scala
def get(v: Int): Boolean = {
  val index = v / 64
  val offset = v % 64
  if (index >= 0 && index < ar.size) {
    val result = ar(index) & (1L << offset)
    result != 0
  } else {
    false
  }
}
```
To avoid repeating the same code for calculating `index` and `offset`
over and over again, let's wrap it into a function that returns the two values.
```scala
def coords(i: Int): (Int, Int) = (i / 64, i % 64)
```
I'm calling it `coords` because these are the coordinates of the value `i` within the bitset.

### Setting a value
To set a value we calculate the `index` and `offset` in the same way
but instead of doing bitwise "and" we perform an "or":
```scala
def set(v: Int): Unit = {
  val (index, offset) = coords(v)
  expand(index)
  ar(index) = ar(index) | (1L << offset)
}
```
This works because the result of performing bitwise "or" on two values
will contain `1` in all places in which there was `1` in any of the two values.
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![image](/assets/2023-01-08-implementing-bitset-in-scala/text38036.svg){:style="margin-left: -60px"}
{: refdef}
Before assigning the value, however, we call the `expand` function to add long
values up to the requested index in case our array is too short.
```scala
def expand(i: Int): Unit = {
  val j = i - (ar.size - 1)
  for (_ <- 0 until j) ar.append(0)
}
```

### Removing a value
To clear a bit (and therefore remove the corresponding integer from the set) shift it by the offset and then negate it to create
0 in that spot and 1s everywhere else:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![image](/assets/2023-01-08-implementing-bitset-in-scala/text34162.svg)
{: refdef}
Then we can do bitwise "and" to clear the bit and leave everything else unchanged:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![image](/assets/2023-01-08-implementing-bitset-in-scala/text38037.svg){:style="margin-left: -60px"}
{: refdef}
```scala
def clear(v: Int): Unit = {
  val (index, offset) = coords(v)
  ar(index) = ar(index) & (~(1L << offset))
}
```

### Operations between two bitsets

When doing the "and" operation between two bitsets A and B we need to
iterate over values stored in A and perform bitwise "and" with
the corresponding value in bitset B or 0 if B has fewer elements than A.
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![image](/assets/2023-01-08-implementing-bitset-in-scala/text38038.svg)
{: refdef}
```scala
def and(s: BitSet): Unit =
  for (i <- ar.indices) {
    val v = if (s.ar.isDefinedAt(i)) s.ar(i) else 0
    ar(i) = ar(i) & v
  }
```
`or` and `xor` operations work similarly, the difference is that we use `|` and `^` instead of `&` to combine the corresponding values.

### Bitset use case
One of the use cases of bitsets is in creating bitmap indexes in databases.
The idea is to create a bitmap for each value of a given attribute.
Let's say we have the following table:
```
+----+------------+-----------+----------------+--------------+
| id | first_name | last_name | marital_status | subscription |
+----+------------+-----------+----------------+--------------+
| 1  | John       | Smith     | single         | free         |
| 2  | Sophia     | Dean      | married        | standard     |
| 3  | Frederick  | Motley    | single         | pro          |
| 4  | Gina       | Harmon    | single         | standard     |
| 5  | Christian  | Daves     | married        | free         |
| 6  | Tamara     | Lane      | married        | pro          |
| 7  | Bernard    | Morrison  | single         | standard     |
| 8  | Zach       | Duncan    | married        | pro          |
+----+------------+-----------+----------------+--------------+
```
We create bitmap indexes for marital status and subscription columns.
For the subscription column, three bitmaps will be created as there are three
distinct values: `free`, `standard` and `pro`:
```
+----+--------+------------+-------+
| id | 'free' | 'standard' | 'pro' |
+----+---------------------+-------+
| 1  | 1      | 0          | 0     |
| 2  | 0      | 1          | 0     |
| 3  | 0      | 0          | 1     |
| 4  | 0      | 1          | 0     |
| 5  | 1      | 0          | 0     |
| 6  | 0      | 0          | 1     |
| 7  | 0      | 1          | 0     |
| 8  | 0      | 0          | 1     |
+----+--------+------------+-------+
```
Similarly for marital status:
```
+----+----------+-----------+
| id | 'single' | 'married' |
+----+----------+-----------+
| 1  | 1        | 0         |
| 2  | 0        | 1         |
| 3  | 1        | 0         |
| 4  | 1        | 0         |
| 5  | 0        | 1         |
| 6  | 0        | 1         |
| 7  | 1        | 0         |
| 8  | 0        | 1         |
+----+----------+-----------+
```
Now let's say we have the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE marital_status = 'married' and subscription = 'pro';
```
The two bitmaps for `marital_status = 'married'` and `subscription = 'pro'`
will be combined using the boolean "and" operation:
```
0     0   0
1     0   0
0     1   0
0 AND 0 = 0
1     0   0
1     1   1
0     0   0
1     1   1
```
Giving as a result the rows with id 6 and 8 which is:
```
+----+------------+-----------+----------------+--------------+
| id | first_name | last_name | marital_status | subscription |
+----+------------+-----------+----------------+--------------+
| 6  | Tamara     | Lane      | married        | pro          |
| 8  | Zach       | Duncan    | married        | pro          |
+----+------------+-----------+----------------+--------------+
```
